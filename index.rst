Introduction
-------------

This *Quick Reference Guide for Data Archivists* provides data
archivists with guidelines to document a micro-dataset in compliance
with the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) and the Dublin Core (DCMI)
metadata standards, using the Microdata Management Toolkit provided by
the International Household Survey Network (IHSN) [1]_. It summarizes
the process in 10 chronological steps:

1.  Gathering and preparing the data set

2.  Gathering and preparing the documentation

3.  Importing data and establishing relationships

4.  Importing external resources

5.  Adding metadata

6.  Creating variable groups (optional)

7.  Running diagnostics

8.  Generating the standard survey documentation using the PDF generator

9.  Quality assessment

10. Producing the output for publication

Also provided (in appendix) is the *IHSN DDI Reviewers’ Feedback Form*
which provides a standard tool for the assessment of survey metadata by
an external reviewer.

This Guide is not an IHSN Toolkit reference or training manual. It is
assumed that users are already familiar with the Toolkit. A *Toolkit*
*User’s Guide* is available at www.surveynetwork.org/guidelines.

Before you start: organizing your files
---------------------------------------

Documentation of a dataset will be considerably facilitated if you
organize your data and other files properly. We recommend that, before
anything else, you create the necessary directories as follows:

1. Gathering and preparing the data set
=======================================

Gathering and preparing data requires great care. Various versions of
the data may have been produced. Before starting to document a dataset,
it is important to ensure that you have the most appropriate version of
all data files. If you are preparing a dataset for public release, you
need the most final, edited, and anonymized version of the data. If you
are documenting a dataset for archiving and internal use only, you may
want to include the raw data (before editing), as well as the final,
fully edited non-anonymized files. The Toolkit provides you with a
possibility to document the specificity of each version of a dataset.

Much of the quality of the output generated by the Toolkit will depend
upon the preparatory work. Although some changes in the data can be made
in the Toolkit, it is highly recommended that the necessary checks and
changes be made in advance using a statistical package. The following
are recommended:

-  Preferably, organize your files in a hierarchical format (not in a
   flat format). Hierarchical files are easier to analyze (as they
   contain less variables to store the same information), and are more
   efficient in terms of data storage (smaller files).

*Flat file:*

.. image:: media/image3.png

*Hierarchical file:*

.. image:: media/image4.png

-  If a dataset contains multiple related files, each record in each
   file must have a unique identifier. This identifier may be made of
   one or multiple variables. These identifiers are also called “key
   variables”, as they are used by statistical packages such as SPSS or
   Stata when data files need to be merged. [2]_ Identifiers must be
   composed of numeric variables only (some software applications,
   including the IHSN Toolkit, require that identifiers be numeric. The
   reason is that sorting and filtering records is much more efficient
   when variables are numeric).

   For the convenience of users of the data, avoid identifiers made of
   too many variables. For example, in a household survey, the household
   identifier will preferably be a single variable (which you may create
   by concatenating a group of variables [3]_), and the individual
   identifier should be the combination of only two variables (the
   household ID, and the sequential number of each member).

   If you prepare your data files for public dissemination, it may be
   preferable to generate a unique household identification that would
   **not** be a compilation of geographic codes (because geographic codes
   are highly identifying). In such case, it is recommended to generate
   an ID based on a sequential number.

   Example: Suppose the unique identification of a household is the
   combination of variables PROV (Province), DIST (District), EA
   (Enumeration Area), HHNUM (Household Number). The following options
   are possible:

=====  =====  =====  ========== ==================== =====================
 Option 1: Use a combination of Option 2: Generate a  Option 3: Generate a
              four variables       concatenated ID       sequential number
------------------------------- -------------------- ---------------------
PROV   DIST    EA    HHNUM      HHID                 HHID
=====  =====  =====  ========== ==================== =====================
12     01     014    004        1201014004           1
12     01     015    001        1201015001           2
13     07     008    112        1307008112           3
Etc    Etc    Etc    Etc        Etc                  Etc
=====  =====  =====  ========== ==================== =====================

Options 2 and 3 are recommended. Note that if option 3 is chosen, it is
crucial to preserve (but not distribute) a file that would provide the
mapping between the original codes and the new HHID.

-  Make sure that, in all data files, the identification variable(s)
   provide a unique identifier. Use the *duplicate* function in SPSS or
   the *isid* command in Stata to verify this.

-  If your dataset is hierarchical, carefully test the file
   relationships (using the *merge* command in SPSS and Stata). For a
   household survey for example, verify the all records in the
   individual-level files have a corresponding household in the
   household-level master file. Verify also that all households have at
   least one corresponding record in the household-roster file that
   lists all individuals.

-  Verify that the number of records in each file corresponds to what is
   expected.

-  Do not include string variables if they can be converted into numeric
   variables. Statistical software is very inefficient when working with
   string variables. In Stata, the *destring* and the *encode* commands can
   be used to make such conversions.

-  Verify the completeness of your data files by comparing the content
   of these files with the survey questionnaire. Make sure that data
   from all sections of the questionnaire are included in the dataset.

-  Verify that all variables are labelled (variable labels), and that
   the codes for all categorical variables are labelled (value labels).
   The labels should be short but precise; a same label should not be
   used for two different variables.

-  For the convenience of the data users, include the relevant weighting
   coefficient variable(s) in all data files if possible.

-  Avoid repeating a same variable in multiple files unless there is a
   good reason for it (variables identifying the household, variables
   such as geographic codes, and weighting variables should be present
   in all files).

-  Remove all unnecessary or temporary variables from the data files
   (the variables that present no interest for secondary users). To be
   useful, a derived variable must be documented. For example, the
   filtering variables (“FILTER$”) generated by SPSS, or the *\_merge*
   variable generated in Stata are not necessary in the files once the
   analysis is done.

-  For sample surveys, verify that the variables identifying the various
   levels of stratification and the primary sample unit are included and
   easily identified in at least one of the data files. These variables
   are needed for the calculation of sampling errors.

-  Put the variables in a logic sequence (using the *order* command in
   Stata if needed or the “/KEEP=” option in SPSS when saving a file).

-  Generate descriptive statistics for all variables (frequencies for
   discrete variables; min/max/mean for continuous variables) and verify
   that these statistics look reasonable.

-  Compress the variables to reduce the file size; use the compress
   command in Stata, or the *compress* option when you save a SPSS data
   file.

-  Sort records by their unique identifier before you save the file.

|                                                                    |
| If you are in the process of establishing a data archive and plan  |
| to document a collection of surveys, undertake a full inventory of |
| all existing data and metadata before you start the documentation. |
| Use the IHSN Inventory Guidelines and Forms to before you start the|
| documentation. Use the *IHSN Inventory Guidelines and Forms* to    |
| facilitate this inventory (available at www.surveynetwork.org).    |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

2. Gathering and preparing the documentation
============================================

All information related to the survey may be useful and should be
archived (even if not all will be disseminated to the public). This
includes not only technical documents such as the questionnaires or list
of codes (obviously needed by data users), but also administrative
reports (potentially useful for implementation of future surveys), and
other documents such as a compilation of the comments provided by
stakeholders at the time the questionnaire was designed, etc. Resources
to be included if available include:

-  The survey questionnaire(s); make sure that the cover page and all
   sections are included. If the questionnaire exists in multiple
   languages, provide all versions.

-  All technical, analytical and administrative documents

   -  Sampling information

   -  Interviewers and supervisors manuals

   -  List of codes

   -  Instructions for data editing

   -  Survey report (tabulation and analysis)

   -  Analytical papers and policy briefs that made use of the data

   -  Survey budget and other key planning documents

   -  Powerpoint presentations and other related material

-  Computer programs (used for data entry, editing, tabulation and
   analysis)

-  Photos

-  Tables

-  Maps

-  Survey promotional/informational materials (flyers, videos, posters,
   songs, etc.)

Documents available in electronic format (MS-Word, Excel, and others)
must be preserved in their original format and in PDF format.

All documents available only on hard copy must be scanned. Use low
resolution graphics, and black & white option (unless it is crucial to
preserve colours) to avoid large file sizes. A scanning resolution of
300 dpi is recommended. Save the scanned documents in PDF format. OCR is
useful, although not required.

Scan all resources with an updated virus detection application.

3. Importing data and establishing relationships
================================================

After all data and documentation files are gathered and checked, import
the data files in the Toolkit. In the Microdata Management Toolkit,
order the files in a logical fashion (e.g. sequentially through
sections).

.. note::
   If you are documenting a population census and have very large
   data files, it is recommended to split the files by geographic area.
   Typically, you will have a file at individual level, one at the
   household level, and possibly one at the community level, for each
   State or Province. In such case, import all files for one State or
   Province only. You will import the other data files after you
   complete the documentation of the files. This will considerably
   reduce the time needed to save your files. The Toolkit will allow you
   to replicate the metadata from the documented files to all other data
   files that you will import later.

After all files are imported and ordered in a proper sequence, define
the key variables for each data file. The base key variable(s) in a data
file is (are) the variable(s) that provide the unique identifier of each
record in that specific data file.

Then establish the relations and validate them using the *Tool >
Validate Relationships* in the Toolkit. This automatic validation is a
way to check the structural integrity of the identifier variables and
assure there are no duplicates in the data.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Establishing relationships – An example                            |
+====================================================================+
|In this example, we assume that the dataset is obtained from a      |
|household budget survey and comprises:                              |
|                                                                    |
|- A household-level file “hhld.dat” with the household              |
|  characteristics (one record per household). Each household is     |
|  identified by a variable named *hhid*.                            |
|                                                                    |
|- A household-level file “hhld.dat” with the household (one record  |
|  per person).Each household member is identified by the combination|
|  of variables *hhid and memno*.                                    |
|                                                                    |
|- A consumption data file “cons.dat”, with one record per item      |
|  (goods and services) per household. Each record is uniquely       |
|  identified by the combination of variables *hhid* and *itemno*.   |
|  The file also contains a variable *district* identifying the      |
|  district where the household resides.                             |
|                                                                    |
|- A data file “prices.dat” with average price per commodity, per    |
|  district (one record per item per district). Each record is       |
|  uniquely identified by variables *district* and *itemno*.         |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                   .. image:: media/image5.png                      |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
|In the IHSN Toolkit, these relationships will be established as     |
|follows in the “Key variables and relationships” section of each    |
|data file:                                                          |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                   .. image:: media/image6.png                      |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

If you have imported your data from any format other than fixed ASCII,
re-sequence the data using the *Variables* > *Resequence* option in the
Toolkit. This re-sequencing tool will automatically fill the “StartCol”
and “EndCol” columns in the variable description section. This must be
done for each data file.

.. image:: media/image7.png

.. image:: media/image8.png

Before going further, quickly browse all variables in all data files to
visually check the frequencies. This will allow you to easily spot some
outliers or invalid codes, which will require recoding (which can be
done in the Toolkit or in the source data files which will then have to
be re-imported).

.. image:: media/Image9_1.PNG

Last, view the content of each data files in the “Data Entry” page. All
data should be displayed in black fonts. Data displayed in bold red
indicate out of range values. Data in bold blue fonts indicate that
value labels are missing for that variable.

.. image:: media/image10.png

Save the file. The Toolkit saves all data files and the information you
already added (on key relationships, etc) in one single file (Nesstar
format). We recommend you save this file in the survey root directory,
using the survey abbreviation, year and version number as file name
(e.g., HIES2007_v11). Note that it is good practice to avoid using
spaces in a file name (use underscore characters instead).

4. Importing external resources
===============================

+----------------------------+-----------------------+------------------+
|Before importing your external resources, create folders in the Toolkit|
|as necessary (these are directories in the External Resources section  |
|in the Toolkit, not new directories on your hard drive). If you have   |
|very few external resources, all resources can be listed in the root   |
|directory. If you have many, organize them by type of resources (in the|
|example below, we have created separate directories for the            |
|Questionnaires, Technical Documents, Computer Programs, Reports,       |
|Tables, Photos and Maps).                                              |
+----------------------------+-----------------------+------------------+
|.. image:: media/image11.png| Create an entry for each resource by     |
|                            | entering a label in the Resource         |
|                            |                                          |
|                            | Information field. This label should be  |
|                            | short but explicit. Then identify the    |
|                            |                                          |
|                            | resource file in the  “Resource” field.  |
|                            | The field “Resource” is used to indicate |
|                            |                                          |
|                            | the filename or URL location (website) of|
|                            | the external resource. The resource      |
|                            |                                          |
|                            | consists of the filename, and a relative |
|                            | path (relative to the directory where    |
|                            |                                          |
|                            | your study Nesstar file is saved). The   |
|                            | reason for entering a relative path is   |
|                            |                                          |
|                            | that it will allow you to move the whole |
|                            | study directory and its subdirectories to|
|                            |                                          |
|                            | another location or another drive,       |
|                            | without having to re-enter the location  |
|                            |                                          |
|                            | of the files.                            |
+----------------------------+-----------------------+------------------+
|Example:                                                               |
|                                                                       |
|Let’s assume your study is a household budget survey conducted in 2007.|
|If you followed the recommendations made in the introductory chapter   |
|“Before you start – Organizing your files”, you will have created a    |
|directory like C:\HIES2007. Your nesstar file will be saved as         |
|HIES2007.Nesstar in this directory. Suppose also that a document titled|
|Report2007.pdf is saved in a directory C:\HIES2007\DOCS. When you fill |
|the resource field in the External Resources page, do NOT enter        |
|“C:\HIES2007\DOCS\Report2007.pdf. Enter the file name as follows:      |
|                                                                       |
|.. image:: media/image12.png                                           |
+----------------------------+-----------------------+------------------+

Some resources might be composed of more than one file (for example, the
CSPro data entry application includes multiple files that should not be
separated). In such cases, zip them into one single file, and import it
as a single resource.

For documents available in multiple formats (for example, a
questionnaire available in Excel and in PDF), you may create two
separate resources, or zip the files into one single file. In such case,
list the different formats available in the “Content/ Description”
field.

5. Completing metadata
======================

The IHSN Toolkit (version 1.n) makes use of the Data Documentation
Initiative (DDI Version 2) and the Dublin Core (DCMI version X) metadata
standards.

A thorough completion of the DDI and DCMI elements will significantly
raise the value of the archiving work by providing users with the
necessary information to put the study into its proper context and to
understand its purpose.

The DDI requires completion of the following sections: Document
Description, Study Description, Data Files Description, Variables
Description, and External Resources Description. Recommendations for
each field included in the IHSN template are provided below.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The IHSN recommends using the standardized IHSN DDI/DCMI templates |
| (Study Template and External Resources Template). This Quick       |
| Reference Guide is based on these two templates. Visit the IHSN    |
| website to download the latest version of these templates,         |
| available in multiple languages.                                   |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

**Overall recommendations:**

-  As an archivist, you may need to seek assistance from key experts
   involved in some of the technical aspects of the survey.

-  As a general rule, avoid using ALL CAPS when you fill DDI fields.
   Also, check the spelling of all entries. The Toolkit does not provide
   (yet) an automatic spell checker.

-  Some of the examples below present an optimal documentation of some
   fields. In many cases, for past surveys, you will not find such
   detailed information. Try to provide as much detail as possible. For
   future surveys, the information should be compiled and provided
   during the whole life cycle of the survey. This will ensure that the
   best possible documentation is available at completion of that
   survey.

5.1. Good practices for completing the Document Description
-----------------------------------------------------------

Documenting a study using the DDI and DCMI metadata standards consists
of generating a metadata file which will be saved in XML format in what
is called an *XML Document*. The *Document Description* described below
is a description of that XML file. The IHSN Template selected 5 elements
to describe the DDI document.

Good practices for completing the File Description
---------------------------------------------------

The File Description is the DDI section that aims to provide a detailed
description of each data file. The IHSN has selected six of the
available DDI elements.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Contents                          | A data filename usually provides  |

Good practices for completing the Variables Description
--------------------------------------------------------

The Variable Description is the section of the DDI document that
provides detailed information on each variable.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Variable Names                    | These are the names given to the  |
|                                   | variables. Ideally, the variable  |
|                                   | names should be a maximum of 8    |
|                                   | characters, and use a logical     |
|                                   | naming convention (e.g., section  |
|                                   | (S) and question (Q) numbers to   |
|                                   | name the question). If the        |
|                                   | variable names do not follow      |
|                                   | these principles, DO NOT CHANGE   |
|                                   | THE VARIABLE NAMES IN THE         |
|                                   | TOOLKIT, but make recommendations |
|                                   | to the data processor for         |
|                                   | consideration for future surveys. |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Variable Labels                   | All variables should have a label |
|                                   | that                              |

|                                   | -  Provides an indication of      |
|                                   |    whether the variable is        |
|                                   |    constructed from other items   |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | -  Do not use ALL CAPS in labels. |

|                                   |    labels (avoid duplicate        |

Good practices for completing the External Resources description
----------------------------------------------------------------

The External Resources are all materials related to the study others
than the data files. They include documents (such as the questionnaires,
interviewer’s manuals, reports, etc), programs (data entry, editing,

.. _section-1:

Creating variable groups
========================

Variable groups are optional, but will help organize the data for the
user into specific subject of use categories. This will be particularly
useful to the user in the case of data files that contain many variables
and are not organized by topic (some flat files contain hundreds or even
thousands of variables).

The Toolkit allows you to group variables found in various separate data
files. For example, education data may be found in various locations and
the disparate variables grouped together. Also, a same variable can
belong to more than one group.

Variable groups are “virtual”. The variables themselves are not moved or
grouped. They remain untouched in the data files.

In the final output of the Toolkit (CD-ROM of website), the variable
groups will appear under a menu item “Data dictionary”. The only reason
for grouping variables is to allow users to easily locate variables
related to their topic of interest. If your dataset contains very few
variables, there is no justification for grouping them.

If you decide to create variable groups (and sub-groups if needed), make
sure that ALL variables in the dataset belong to at least one group.

Variable groups also have their own DDI elements which include Type,
Label, Text, Definition, Universe, and Notes. These elements are
optional and will in most cases be left empty.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Type                              | This is a controlled vocabulary   |
|                                   | field. It best identifies the     |
|                                   | manner the variables are grouped  |
|                                   | together. This field is optional. |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Label                             | The label used to identify the    |
|                                   | group should be clear and relate  |
|                                   | to the type chosen. If these are  |
|                                   | grouped by subject, then the      |
|                                   | subject should be clearly stated  |
|                                   | etc.                              |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Text                              | Include additional text to        |
|                                   | clarify the reason or purpose for |
|                                   | grouping the variables. This      |
|                                   | field is optional.                |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Definition                        | This optional field is used to    |
|                                   | define the variable group.        |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Universe                          | This optional field defines the   |
|                                   | universe relevant to the selected |
|                                   | grouped variables. The variables  |
|                                   | for example can be grouped as     |
|                                   | “Fertility Data” and the universe |
|                                   | restricted to women between the   |
|                                   | ages of 15-49.                    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Notes                             | Additional space for further      |
|                                   | optional explanatory notes.       |

Running validations and diagnostics
===================================

The Microdata Management Toolkit includes a useful series of diagnostic
and validation modules (see the drop down menu *Tools*): these range
from very simple validations (such as the *Tools-Validate Metadata*) to
complex visual displays that iterate through each variable and provides
feedback to the archivist at the variable level.

-  *Validate Metadata*: verifies that all mandatory fields are filled
   in.

-  *Validate External Resources*: verifies all mandatory fields in the
   External Resources are filled in.

-  *DDI Diagnostic*: this provides a visual display and issues warnings
   if DDI elements are missing. It also displays information at the file
   level and identifies any variables with missing labels, discrete
   variables with missing value or code label, variables with the same
   name or frequency displays with more than 30 modalities.

-  *DDI Diagnostic Detailed*: this provides a more in-depth display as
   the simpler DDI diagnostic (above). It checks the metadata at the
   individual variable level and checks: labelling, definitions,
   universe, source etc.

-  *Dublin Core diagnostic*: Checks the metadata provided for the
   External Resources.

In addition to these validations, it is recommended that you generate
the DDI document (in the Toolkit, use the Export DDI” command) and
verify the size of the resulting [.xml] file. A fully documented survey
with a large number of variables should not produce a file larger than
10Mb. Very large DDI files often indicate errors in the selection of
summary statistics (for example, frequencies are produced for a variable
like the household ID in a sample household file).

Generating the survey documentation in PDF
==========================================

The Microdata Management Toolkit includes a useful tool for producing a
PDF document summarizing all metadata entered in the Toolkit (see *Tools
> Study Documentation PDF*). Generating this report is one of the final
stages of properly preparing a survey for publication and dissemination.
If previous versions exist and changes have been made to the data files
or the metadata make sure you re-run the PDF generator.

This report should be generated, saved and attached as an *External
Resource*.

One thing to keep in mind is that in a survey with a large number of
variables may produce a document that is very long. If the report is in
excess of 300 or 350 pages, you may want to split this report (e.g.,
produce one report with the study metadata, and one with the files and
variables metadata), or change the content options (e.g., not including
a frequency table for all variables).

Producing the final output
==========================

Once you are confident that all necessary checks have been completed,
you may generate the final output using the CD-ROM Builder module of the
IHSN Toolkit. This includes the CD-ROM and survey website.

Before you generate the CD-ROM:

-  Make sure you have a customized “branding” for the CD-ROM. If you
   don’t, design a branding (instructions are provided in the Toolkit
   User’s Guide).

-  Prepare content for the “Home page” of the CD-ROM. Typically, a
   statement by the Director of the data producing agency, or a brief
   summary of the objectives and findings of the survey, will be
   generated.

Generate the CD-ROM with the appropriate options. The IHSN recommends:

-  To generate the CD-ROM without data

-  To export all datasets to ASCII format, and to include the zipped
   ASCII files on the CD-ROM, together with the syntax file to export
   the data to SPSS, Stata and other formats (which shoulod be provided
   as external resources). The ASCII format is more standard than the
   Toolkit Nesstar format, and is a guarantee of long-term viability of
   your data files.

-  To include an autorun file.

-  To include all external resources.

-  To check that the CD-ROM outline does not include any empty pages
   (use the Toolkit utility to check)

-  To name the CD-ROM according to the dataset abbreviation and version.

After you generate the CD-ROM:

-  Check all links before you replicate it, in particular the ones to
   external resources.

-  Test the autorun.

If your agency has a website, you may upload the content of the CD-ROM
directly to the web server. The IHSN recommends the use of a proper
DDI-compliant cataloguing system, such as the one provided by its
National Data Archive (NADA) application. NADA is an open source
package, available free of charge at www.surveynetwork.org.

Independent quality review
==========================

An independent review of the data and metadata is highly recommended
prior to publishing the final output. The Appendix provides a blank
review form (the *DDI Reviewer’s Feedback Form*) to be used by an
external reviewer. The IHSN can assist in identifying external
reviewers.

The external review can be based on:

1. The DDI file (xml file, containing no microdata and no external
   resources)

2. The Nesstar file (containing microdata and DDI/DCMI metadata)

3. The CD-ROM (or website), without microdata

4. The CD-ROM (or website), with microdata

The preferred option is the last one, as it allows a full check of the
final output. If data are highly confidential and cannot be shared with
the reviewer, option 3 is the most appropriate.

In order to prepare for the independent quality review, proceed to step
10 if you will use options three or four. Follow the guidance there, and
then finalize the archiving before producing the final output. Else,
send the DDI-XML or the Nesstar file to the reviewer.

   In Stata, this can be done through the use of the *group* function
   from the *egen* command. For example, to create a variable hhid based
   on a combination of variables *province*, *district*, *ea* and
   *hhnum*, use the command “egen hhid=group(province district ea hh_num
   )”.
